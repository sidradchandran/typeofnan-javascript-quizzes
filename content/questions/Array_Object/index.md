Which of the following array methods is guaranteed to iterate through each element of an array?

<!-- explanation -->

`forEach()` calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array in ascending order. `every()` will stop as soon as the provided function results in a falsey condition. `concat()` simply combines two arrays.
